; Testing using a small dataset
;
; Specify boundaries of coordinate space:
;
world	-794530	-792630

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Latitude/longitude values in index entries are shown as signed integers, in total seconds.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
						World boundaries are set to:
						           383000
						-794530              -792630
						           381000

;
; Import the dataset [the address here is a relative address]
Command 1: import	./VA_Monterey.txt

;
; Lets visualize our already imported geographical data
;
; Also lets see what is inside name and coordinate indices
;
; To fill out the cache, let's do a single-match location search
;
; Now lets see if our cache is filled up
;
; A few more search queries
what_is	Church	VA
No records match "Church" and "VA"
; oops Church is "FEATURE_CLASS" how about the following query?
what_is	Central Church	VA
Highland (38d 29m 53s North, 79d 33m 23s West)
what_is	Town of Monterey	VA
 (0d 0m 0s North, 0d 0m 0s East)
what_is	Smith Field	VA
 (0d 0m 0s North, 0d 0m 0s East)
; Let's try a wrong state abbreviation
what_is	Smith Field	CO
No records match "Smith Field" and "CO"
;
; Lets check the buffer pool again
;
; So lets check the LRU mechanism [this query should move the last element of the cache all the way to the front!]
;
; checking the buffer pool again
;
; More location searches
; We expect two location matches for this one
;
; Now performing some area search [this should return 7 features]
;
; checking the buffer pool again
; how about querying somewhere outside boundaries ?
; Let's try some variations of a single-match region search with a square region:
; Let's try increasing the size of the region:
;
; Let's import a larger dataset [wait a second, VA_Bath has 520 records, why didn't all of them get imported? explain this in your report]
Command 2: import	./VA_Bath.txt

; as import command bypasses the buffer pool, content of the buffer pool should remain intact
;
; Exiting
;
; From this point on all of the commands will be ignored, you can use the following large dataset to test your implemented software
; To consider this file please use the following world command at the beginning of this file
; world	1130000W	0690000W	300000N	440000N
Command 3: import	CO_All.txt

;
; And some searches; let's see if you're taking the state abbreviation into account:
what_is	Lincoln	CO
No records match "Lincoln" and "CO"
what_is	Lincoln	NM
No records match "Lincoln" and "NM"
;
; Let's try spanning the border:
;
; Let's try a larger region and filter the results:
;
; And some more or less random searches:
what_is	Slab Mill Gulch	CO
No records match "Slab Mill Gulch" and "CO"
what_is	Kemper School	CO
No records match "Kemper School" and "CO"
